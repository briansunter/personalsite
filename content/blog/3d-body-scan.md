# WebGL 3d body scan

A new store opened up in the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco called [Pocket Me](http://www.pocketme.com "Pocket Me"). This store promised to 3D-print a realistic miniature figurine of anything. I was equally interested in getting a high quality 3d object file for use in the browser and in games. It looks like a mini action figure.

## Getting the scan
The pocketme storefront was full of very creative uses of the 3D scanner and printer. There are examples of 3D prints with entire families, dogs, and even a model of someone holding their 3d model. I went in the back and stood in the middle of circle of pillars containing lights and small cameras. The scan itself only took a second because each camera around me took a picture at the same time. The model was manually touched up by an artist and the 3d object and texture were emailed to me. The 3D printout came a few weeks later and sits on my desk at work. The 3D-printed model, the touch up, and the original 3d object file were around $100 in total.
