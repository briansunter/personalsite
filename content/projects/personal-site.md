# My Personal Site

This site was made with [Perun](https://perun.io/guides/ "Link to perun homepage") a collection of plugins for boot, a Clojure build system. My site is a folder of files with metadata. It is able to parse many different types of files like markdown, asciidoc, and org-mode.

``` clj
(map inc '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10))
