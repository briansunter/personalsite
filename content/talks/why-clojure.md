# Why Clojure?
Why would someone want to use a language besides the one they're already using?

# Immutability
- Don't mutate data. Always return a new "copy"
- Deep support for effecient immutable data structures like lists and maps
- Programs are easier to test and reason about
- Easier concurrency

# Mutable
We have an array reference that we call 'push' on.
``` js
var myArray = ['one', 'two', 'three'];

function addOne(item) {
  myArray.push(item);
}
```

# Immutable
When we add an element to the vector, we get a new vector and the original is unchanged.
``` clj
(def my-new-vector (conj my-vector "four"))
```

# Pure Functions
- Easiest units of software to reason about
- Can be described by inputs and outputs
- Easy to test and compose
- Work extremely well with immutable data structures

# (S Expressions)
- Represent the program as a list of data
- No syntax sugar. Built in functions can be replaced
- No differentiation between statements and expressions (functions that return something)
- Easily composable

# (S Expression)
```clj
(if (= a b) "foo" "bar")
(my-if (= a b) "foo" "bar")
(my-if (my-fn a b) "foo" "bar")
```
# Macros
- Don't wait for a language committee to release features
- New features and syntax can be built from the language it
- Add your own if statement, polymorphism, types, inheritance, pattern matching, etc

# Interactive Programming
- Interact with your code as you write itself
- Extremely fast feedback loop
- Experiment with libraries and ideas
- Excellent editor integration

# Destructuring
Extremely good support for extracting information from collections

``` clj
(let [{:keys [name location description]} client]
  (println name location "-" description))
```

# Easy to test
Testing is much easier when your program is mostly pure functions and immutable data structures. Less need for stubs and mocks.

# Easy to Test
``` clj
(deftest test-capitalize-entries
  (let [employee {:last-name "smith"
                  :job-title "engineer"
                  :level 5
                  :office "seattle"}]
    ;; Passes
    (is (= (capitalize-entries employee :job-title :last-name)
           {:job-title "Engineer"
            :last-name "Smith"
            :office "seattle"
            :level 5}))))
```

# Interop
Interop with Java and Javascript
```clj
(System/getProperty "java.vm.version")
```

# Concurrency and Parallelism
- Immutability and pure functions
- Software Transactional Memory (Atoms)
- "Go Channels" (CSP)
- Agents
- Everything in Java

# Good Design
Strong notions of things like time, identity, and equality

# I must have types
Types are a strong form of coupling in your program. Types encourage giving bogus names to "some of this and that" types.

# Clojure.Spec

# Pure Functions and Immutable Data Structures
Instead of mutating existing data structures, Clojure encourages you to use immutable data structures. In many languages you create a mutable array object and append to it.


We mutate the original array.

``` js
addOne('four');
myArray
```

In Clojure, whenever you "append" to an vector (array) you get a "new" vector and the orignal does not change. Anyone with a reference to the original can always count on it being the same.

``` clj
(def my-vector ["one" "two" "three"])
my-vector
```

``` clj
(def my-new-vector (conj my-vector "four"))
my-new-vector

```

```clj
my-vector

```
Since we can't mutate existing data, we're encouraged to use pure functions. You can count on these functions always returning the same value for a given input. Functions like `reverse` return a new vector, rather than mutating the original.

``` js
const myArray = ["one", "two", "three"];
myArray.reverse();

myArray
```

``` clj
(def my-vector ["one" "two" "three"])
(reverse my-vector)

```

Our original vector is unchanged.
``` clj
my-vector
```

This encourages us to use compositions of functions instead of functions that mutate objects. This makes a lot of things simpler and gives us confidence that changes in one part of the code won't affect areas in another. We just need to focus on the scope of the function, the inputs, and the outputs. We don't need to worry about prior state.

# (but (there (are (so (many (parens (ðŸ™€)))))))
The first thing everyone notices in Clojure is how many parens there are and how dense the code is. It takes some getting used to, but the parens have a lot of benefits.
We can always rewrite syntax repetition with macros and there are plenty of techniques for reducing the number of parens including "threading" operators like `->>`. The following is equivalent to the header.


Function calls are different in clojure than most languages. It is represented by a list where the first element is the function, and the rest are the arguments to that function.

``` clj

(defn my-function
  [arg1 arg2]
  (str arg1 arg2))

(my-function "first" "second")
```

The syntax is extremely regular. It's natural to wrap a function in another function.

``` clj
(my-function (my-function "first" "second") "third")
```

Since all functions including built in functions are called the same way, it's easy to swap any function out with another, including built-ins.

The parens replace a lot of the curly brace notation in other languages.

``` js
function myFunction(arg1, arg2) {
  if (arg1.length !== 0) {
    return arg1;
  } else {
    return arg2;
  }
}
```

``` clj
(defn my-function
  [arg1 arg2]
  (if (not (blank? arg1))
     arg1
     arg2))
```
# Macros
Go has support for asynchronous "go channels" due to special syntax baked into the language. Clojure added the same features and syntax as a third party library. In Javascript you have to wait for syntax to be adopted but in Clojure it could by anyone.

# I must have types
I initially disliked clojure coming from my semi strongly typed Java and C++. How was I supposed to `âŒ˜+R` to refactor all instances of `foo` when I add a field in my IDE. I should have been asking why I needed to change 23 files. If you use types you have to consider the limits of what they do and the cost of the coupling introduced by type information flowing through your program.

# Win Without Fighting
Part of using clojure is a win without fighting approach. If you can write your programs using pure functions and dealing with data on a need to know basis, you can write dramatically simpler code which lessens your need for a type system. When everything deals with data the tests are also much simpler and easier to write. I like taking the extra time I save fighting with a type and investing it in tests, which I feel do more for correctness.
